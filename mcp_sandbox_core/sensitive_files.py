mcp-sandbox-servers/sensitive_files.py

Content-class denylist for sensitive files (secrets, credentials, private keys).

This is DELIBERATELY separate from path_guard.py:
  - path_guard.py answers: "is this path inside the sandbox boundary?" (geometric)
  - sensitive_files.py answers: "is this path a class of file we never touch,
    even if it's fully inside the sandbox?" (content-class denylist)

Two different questions, two different lifecycles — path_guard's boundary
rarely changes, but this denylist will grow constantly as we discover new
secret-file patterns. Keeping them separate means editing this file never
risks touching the boundary-check logic.
